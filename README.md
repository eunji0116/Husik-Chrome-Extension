# Husik (Chrome-Extension)

It's my first project using skills of `jQuery, javascript, css, and html`. \
This is a New Tab (Chrome Extension) inspired by **Momentum**

It's pretty simple (though it wasn't simple to create one) and easy to use.
It has the following features:
  * Default weather location is @Seattle
  * Click on the weather to see an enlarged version of weather info. 
  * Location for weather can be easily updated by simply deleting the location text and rewriting the new location (It can be city, country or even zip code). Then hit `enter`.
  * Temperature unit can be changed by clicking `...` on the detailed weather screen.
  * Todo-list can be created by writing your goals, then hit `enter`
  * After goals are completed, simply click accompolished goals for "check" or delete by clicking `x`
  * Time format can be changed by simply clicking time
  * Day shows when hovering over the date
